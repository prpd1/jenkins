# Jenkins-Zero-To-Hero
Install Jenkins, configure Docker as slave, set up cicd, deploy applications to k8s and much more.

To start with we will create 2 ec2 instances on AWS where we will use one instance as Jenkins Master and the other one as Jenkins Slave.

```
```

On the first instance, Install Jenkins.

Pre-Requisites:
 - Java (JDK)

Run the below commands to install Java and Jenkins

Install Java

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install openjdk-11-jre
```

Verify Java is Installed

```
java -version
```

Now, you can proceed with installing Jenkins

```
curl -fsSL https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable/jenkins.io.key | sudo tee \
  /usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc > /dev/null
echo deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc] \
  https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable binary/ | sudo tee \
  /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jenkins.list > /dev/null
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install jenkins
```

By default, Jenkins will not be accessible to the external world due to the inbound traffic restriction by AWS. But in this case, you should be able to
acccess the Jenkins from your browser as we have configured the inbound traffic rules to allow `All Trrafic` during the creation of instance.

Login to Jenkins using the below URL:

http://<ec2-instance-public-ip-address>:8080    [You can get the ec2-instance-public-ip-address from your AWS EC2 console page]

Note: If you are not interested in allowing `All Traffic` to your EC2 instance
      1. Delete the inbound traffic rule for your instance
      2. Edit the inbound traffic rule to only allow custom TCP port `8080`
  
After you login to Jenkins, 
      - Run the command to copy the Jenkins Admin Password - `sudo cat /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword`
      - Enter the Administrator password
